Our program will implement a famous "game" called Conway's game of Life.
Look up the game of life on youtube, it is beautiful complexity arising from a simple set of rules.
The reason we are thinking about doing this program, is because the implementation itself is quite simple.
This will give us room to explore the reason this language is currently backed by google: it works cross platform.
The main thing that we will be doing in this project is demonstrating that it runs both as a mobile app, and 
works on a browser, with the same code.
The program's core will be simple, and so we will get to explore what makes this language powerful.
